# Tezos Ledger Wallet App Revamped

## Compile using `docker` containers for build dependencies

Start by preparing docker images for building:

1. Follow https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-builder to build the ledger app builder environment.
2. Build the docker image to run the OCaml scripts (needed to generate some parts of the app, and for the tests).

At the time this README was written, it consists in the following commands:

```
git clone git@github.com:LedgerHQ/ledger-app-builder.git <somewhere>
(cd <somewhere> && docker build -t ledger-app-builder:latest .)
docker build -t ledger-app-tezos-ocaml -f docker/Dockerfile.ocaml docker
```

You're all set, just run `make` now, binaries for each `<model>` (S, S+ or X) should be available in `bin/<model>`.
