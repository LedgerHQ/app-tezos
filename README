# Tezos Ledger Wallet App Revamped

## Compile using `docker` containers for build dependencies

Start by preparing docker images for building:

1. Follow https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-builder to build the ledger app builder environment.
2. Follow https://speculos.ledger.com/user/docker.html to build the ledger app simulator Speculos
3. Build the docker image to run the OCaml scripts (needed to generate some parts of the app, and for the tests).

At the time this README was written, it consists in the following commands:

```
git clone git@github.com:LedgerHQ/ledger-app-builder.git <somewhere>
(cd <somewhere> && docker build -t ledger-app-builder:latest .)
docker pull ghcr.io/ledgerhq/speculos
docker image tag ghcr.io/ledgerhq/speculos speculos
docker build -t ledger-app-tezos-ocaml -f docker/Dockerfile.ocaml docker
```

You're all set, just run `make` now, binaries for each `<model>` (S, S+ or X) should be available as `tgz` archives at the root.
